Projects: AI-Powered Resume Ranker &amp;&amp; Credit Card Fraud Detection

This combined AI/ML project report showcases two highly relevant and practical applications of machine learning:
1)AI-Powered Resume Ranker – a natural language processing (NLP) tool to screen and rank candidate resumes based on job descriptions.
2)Credit Card Fraud Detection – a real-world classification system that detects fraudulent transactions using structured financial data.
Both projects are built using foundational ML tools, enhanced with intelligent logic, and written for clarity, usability, and real-world impact.


1) AI-Powered Resume Ranker is a practical machine learning project aimed at streamlining the recruitment process by automatically evaluating and ranking resumes based on their relevance to a given job description. In real-world hiring scenarios, recruiters often face the challenge of reviewing hundreds of resumes manually, which is not only time-consuming but also prone to inconsistency and human bias. This system addresses that problem using fundamental NLP techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to compare the textual content of resumes with a job description. Each resume is assigned a match score that reflects how closely it aligns with the job requirements. The model further enhances interpretability by identifying which skills or keywords from the job description are present in each resume, helping recruiters make informed decisions. Its simplicity, transparency, and effectiveness make it a valuable tool for startups, HR teams, and applicant tracking systems looking to optimize their candidate screening process. Looking ahead, this project has several promising directions for growth, including integrating semantic understanding with models like BERT, section-wise resume analysis, and building a user-friendly web interface for real-time use. Ultimately, this project demonstrates how well-designed, lightweight AI tools can be applied to solve real hiring challenges with both efficiency and fairness.


2) The Credit Card Fraud Detection project is a machine learning-based solution designed to detect fraudulent financial transactions from real-world credit card data. In today’s digital economy, fraud detection has become a mission-critical application for banks and payment platforms, where even small lapses can lead to major financial losses. This project uses the widely referenced Kaggle dataset, which contains anonymized transaction data and includes a highly imbalanced target label—only a tiny fraction of the transactions are fraudulent. To address this challenge, the project implements key strategies such as using the RandomForestClassifier with class weighting and applying SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the training data. This ensures the model can learn to detect fraudulent patterns effectively without being overwhelmed by the dominant class. After training, the model is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and the ROC-AUC metric, which are more meaningful than accuracy for imbalanced data. The confusion matrix and feature importance visualizations further aid in understanding model behavior and interpretability. In practical terms, this project simulates how a real-time fraud detection system could operate in banks, fintech platforms, or e-commerce environments. Future improvements could include integrating time-based anomaly detection, live transaction scoring using APIs, or deploying the model into a streaming architecture. Overall, the project balances clarity, performance, and real-world applicability, making it an ideal candidate for production use and an excellent demonstration of applied machine learning in cybersecurity and finance.


## For project 2 Credit Card Fraud Detection 
This project uses the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle.
Due to GitHub file size limits, the dataset is not included in this repository. Please download it directly from Kaggle to run the code.
